// Apparently GCC 7.3 on MinGW64 is only paying attention to these 'pack' pragmas (which are traditionally the MSVC
// way to override data alignment & packing choices of the compiler) while actually _ignoring_ GCC's traditional
// __attribute__((packed)) system for expressing the same stuff. IDEK, man.

// TODO: Investigate this further so that we can be as portable as we'd like to be for this library. Particularly:
// A) Does GCC just support the MSVC pragmas on all platforms now? If so, which version added this, because we
//    should just use whatever approach is unified (though I personally prefer GCC-style attributes to pragmas).
// B) Does Clang support these pragmas?

// Explanation of packing pragmas:
//
// Until we pop this pragma, `pack` shall be set to 1, which means that every variable/class declaration
// recursively encountered will be "packed into place" by the compiler on 1-byte boundaries (i.e., maximum possible
// packing with no ability for the compiler to add any padding bytes to align data â€” in contrast, one could specify
// 2 and the compiler would be allowed to add a padding byte to an inconveniently placed 'char' variable in order
// to at least make it accessible on a 16-bit memory address if the compiler thinks it will actually improve any
// performance). Full documentation is on MSDN somewhere, although I guess that w/ GCC now supporting it at least
// on the MinGW-64 port, there's probably plenty of other docs too.
